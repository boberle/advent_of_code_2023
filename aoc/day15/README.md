# AOC 2023, day 15

This one is pretty easy. There is no "trick", just follow the instructions and you get the answer quickly.

Of course, the fact that dictionaries in Python are sorted is of great help! (No one uses versions of Python in which dictionaries are not sorted, right?)

It's so easy that I'm very worried about the difficulty of day 16!
